# EZproxy_LogFileAnalysis
Python script to analyze EZproxy SPU logs [Forked]

Code4Lib article: https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/13918

Script requires the following Python libraries to run:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

I recommend installing Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to run the code and manage libraries

# Previous Month
Run the EZProxy-PrevMonth script to capture the data from the previous month (the script formats filenames and HTML based on the previous month)

# Full Year
Run the EZProxy-FY script to capture data for a larger period of time. This one doesn't create a By Day chart/table.
